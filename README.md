# Hello there 👋

I'm an Alabama-based [Software Engineer]([https://mindsize.com](https://gregrickaby.com/resume/), [self-taught photographer](https://flickr.com/people/gregrickaby/), and [published author](https://www.amazon.com/author/gregrickaby). Outside of work, you’ll find me behind a camera, tossing pizzas, or planning the next family road trip. ✌️
