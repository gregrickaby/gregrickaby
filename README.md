# ðŸ‘‹ Hello There

I'm a [web developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregrickaby/), [photographer](https://flickr.com/photos/gregrickaby), and [author](https://www.amazon.com/author/gregrickaby) who's been building websites since the [Geocities](https://gregrickaby.com/geocities) days.

As a Tech Lead at [Mindsize](https://mindsize.com), I support a talented team working on e-commerce solutions with Next.js. Outside of work, I'm married with three kids, and enjoy cooking, reading, and traveling.
