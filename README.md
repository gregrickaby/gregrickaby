# ðŸ‘‹ Hello There

I'm a [web developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregrickaby/), [photographer](https://gregrickaby.com/photos), and [author](https://www.amazon.com/author/gregrickaby) who's been building websites since the [Geocities](https://gregrickaby.com/geocities) days.

Married with three kids, I enjoy cooking, traveling, and reading. As a Technical Lead at [Mindsize](https://mindsize.com), I support a talented team working on e-comm solutions with Next.js.
