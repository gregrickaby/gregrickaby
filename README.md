# üëã Hello there

I'm a [web developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregrickaby/), [photographer](https://flickr.com/people/gregrickaby/), and [published author](https://www.amazon.com/author/gregrickaby) who's been building websites since the [Geocities](https://gregrickaby.com/geocities) days.

Currently I'm a Tech Lead at [Mindsize](https://mindsize.com), where I support a talented team working on e-commerce solutions with Next.js. Outside of work, I'm married with three kids and enjoy cooking, reading, and traveling. ‚úåÔ∏è
